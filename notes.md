Based on the example shown in the training, implement an order processing application.
The process should look like this:
- the customer sends a list of ordered products
- the application creates and returns an order that contains product information and status
- the order is saved (inMemory)
  Additionally, the application should return the order status after entering its ID

Configure application with annotation and then with JavaConfig (factories)

Write cache aspect and apply it on method returning orders
